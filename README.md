# Composable function programming

This is my lab space to explore and experiment with composable function programming, understand the main
concepts, and get used to the mindset.

- [simple pure js experiments](concepts-pure-js/README.md)
- [creating of my own compose functions to compose(pipe) functions](compose-with-ts/README.md)
- [using compose in a more realistic web environment](using-compose-web/README.md)
